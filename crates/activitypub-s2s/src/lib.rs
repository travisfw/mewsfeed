//! ActivityPub S2S protocol types for MewsFeed federation.
//!
//! This crate defines the full ActivityPub protocol types used by the S2S module
//! (running natively in Tauri/Electron). These types handle JSON-LD serialization
//! and are NOT used by the Holochain zome (which uses `federation_types` instead).
//!
//! The S2S module converts between these protocol types and the simpler state types
//! in `federation_types` when communicating with the zome over AppWebsocket.
